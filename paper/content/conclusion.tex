\section{CONCLUSION \& FUTURE WORKS}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper proposes a methodology for training DNNs to perform several distinct behavioral modalities simultaneously, through the insertion of modal information. This MultiNet approach is shown to exceed the performance of multiple individual networks trained separately, while using fewer parameters. These results are then verified with real world evaluation of the networks in sidewalk driving situations using 1/10th scale model cars. Future work could include work on adapting the approach to full size vehicles and making modal information available from higher-level networks trained to select behavioral modes, thereby granting the system a qualitatively higher level of autonomy.
